This commit marks a major milestone. All project requirements (FR1-FR20) and Use Cases (UC1-UC17) are now fully operational.

CORE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- Admin Dashboard: Centralized management for users, courses, and platform settings.
- LMS Sync Service: Developed connectors for Moodle, Canvas, and Blackboard to handle grade synchronization.

- Enhanced navigation with clickable stat cards and hover effects.

STABILITY & SECURITY:

- Resolved authentication routing: System now correctly redirects based on user roles (Admin/Instructor/Student).
- Secured sensitive data handling for AI and LMS API keys.

FILES & ARCHITECTURE:
- Added: 20+ templates, lms_service.py, adaptive_insights_service.py.
